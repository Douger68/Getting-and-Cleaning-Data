# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
I hadto create a script calls run_analysis.R which would merge test and training sets together and form a clean dataset. The steps were:  
1. Download the dataset 
2. Load all the information into R	
3. Merge the training and testing datasets into 1 dataset   
4. Convert the activity and subject columns into facts  
5. clean and save the dataset into a tidy dataset with average value of each variable for each subject and activity pair
